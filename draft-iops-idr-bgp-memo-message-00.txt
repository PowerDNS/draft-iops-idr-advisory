1.  Introduction

   This document defines the BGP-4 [RFC4271] MEMO Message and MEMO
   Capability to facilitate the exchange of human-oriented information
   specific to the BGP-4 session through which the MEMO is distributed.
   In concept this enhancement is similar to the dissemination of plan
   files [RFC1288], and not intended for real-time communication.

2.  Protocol Extensions

   The BGP protocol extensions introduced in this document include the
   definition of a new BGP capability, named "MEMO Capability", and the
   specification of the MEMO message.

2.1.  MEMO Capability

   The "Support for MEMO Message Capability" is a new BGP capability
   [RFC5492].  The Length field of this capability MUST be set to 1.
   The Capability value MUST be set to the version of the MEMO message
   supported by the BGP speaker.  This document only defines MEMO
   version 1 messages.

   By advertising this capability to a peer, a BGP speaker conveys to
   the peer that the speaker supports receiving MEMO messages, indicates
   what version of the MEMO message it supports, and supports the
   related procedures described in this document.

2.2.  MEMO Message

   A MEMO message is composed of one or more key-value pairs.  A MEMO
   message MUST NOT contain more than 16 key-value pairs.  Each key and
   each value field MUST be proceeded by a one octet Length field to
   indicate the length of the subsequent field.  MEMO key fields have a
   REQUIRED maximum length of 32 octets.  MEMO value fields have a
   REQUIRED maximum length of 128 octets.  To support international
   characters, both key and value fields MUST be encoded using UTF-8.
   Fields are not NUL terminated.

2.2.1.  MEMO Message Example

   A MEMO message example:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   Length:  9  | Key "noc email" |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   Length: 11  | Value "noc@ntt.net" |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   Length: 10  | Key "24/7 phone"  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   Length: 15  | Value "+1 877 688-6625"     |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   Length: 10  | Key: "Service ID" |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   Length: 13  | Value: "USID 89024294"  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

3.  Operational Considerations

   TBD

3.1.  CLI / UI Mock-up - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION

   This section is not meant to drive UI design decisions, but rather as
   scaffold to further discussion.

4.  Error Handling

   This document defines a new NOTIFICATION error code: "MEMO Message
   Error".  The following new error subcode is defined as well: "Invalid
   Message Length".

   The error handling specified in this section is applicable only when
   a BGP speaker has received the "Support for MEMO Message Capability"
   from a peer.

   All errors detected while processing the MEMO message MUST be
   indicated by sending the NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code
   MEMO Message Error.  The error subcode elaborates on the specific
   nature of the error.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign value TBD1 (MEMO) in the "BGP Message
   Types" subregistry under the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
   Parameters" registry.

   IANA is requested to assign value TBD2 (MEMO Message Error) in the
   "BGP Error (Notification) Codes" subregistry under the "Border
   Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters" registry.

   IANA is requested to create a new registry "MEMO Message Error
   subcodes" for error subcodes, under the "BGP Error Subcodes"
   subregistry under the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters"
   registry.  The Registration Procedure for this new registry is "First
   Come First Served".  IANA is requested to assign value TBD3 (Invalid
   Message Length) in this new error subcode registry.

   IANA is requested to assign value TBD4 (Support for MEMO Message
   Capability) in the "Capability Codes" registry.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document uses UTF-8 encoding for the MEMO message.  UNICODE TR36
   [UTR36] to learn about these
